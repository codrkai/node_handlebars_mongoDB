# Node with Express Handlebars and MongoDB database connection

** Please note that this project uses the "hbs" library and not the "express-handlebars" library **

This tutorial will help you set up a mongoose database for your node js project. You can sign up for free at mongodb.com to use their free clusters for testing.

Here's what will be covered in this tutorial:
- Setting up MongoDB: Cluster, Database Access, Creating Document tables
- Setting up the Schemas in our NodeJS project
- Connecting to the database in NodeJS to pull data to display on our webpage, and saving data to our database using a form from the homepage.

* Remember to set up your MongoDB Node database like my Schemas or this project will not run *

Install node either by going to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or [homebrew](https://brew.sh)
